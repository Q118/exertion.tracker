## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

* Start by running `npm init` in the terminal
* Next install dependencies with the command: `npm i`
* Then, start the app with typing `npm start` into the terminal.
